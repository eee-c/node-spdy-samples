# Server Push Example

This example runs on node-spdy 0.6.x only -- *not* on the unstable 0.7 series. It requires openssl 1.0.1 or higher. See [install instructions](https://github.com/eee-c/express-spdy/blob/master/INSTALL.md) in [express-spdy](https://github.com/eee-c/express-spdy) for info (or use Ubuntu 12.04).

If you have node.js setup properly, you should be able to run this by:

    npm install
    node app
